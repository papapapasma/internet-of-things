<h3>Five Most Common Problems IoT Devices Will Encounter in 2020</h3>
<h4>
    Operating environment: The wide range of operating environments will be a key factor in smart device functionality. This includes issues with IoT uptime caused by environmental conditions, including extreme temperatures, rough device handling, WIFI availability/signal blockage, etc.
<BR>>ntegration problems: Many new smart home devices require their own app that may or may not integrate with various routers, smart hubs and other systems in the home. Popular apps and services may only be available on specific devices. As the number and variety of devices proliferate, consumers in 2020 can expect to see higher malfunction rates.
<BR>Device configuration: Smart device configuration should be very user-friendly. However, many devices still require manual intervention. The requirement for AI-based configuration is obvious in this situation in order to ensure a fast and effective setup for devices. The ability to auto-configure such devices will be critical for smart device/home enablement as consumers bring a broader range of more complex smart devices into their homes.
<BR>Connectivity: Smart device connectivity (or lack thereof) will be a significant contributor to device malfunctioning in 2020. The problems include a lack of signaling or bidirectional communication between devices for collection and routing purposes. Thereâ€™s also the issue of presence detection, where the smart hub/router must be able to detect when a smart device drops offline and when it rejoins the network. This gives the ability to monitor the device and fix any problems that may arise.
<BR>Device load: Device load and bandwidth limitations are other challenges expected to increase in 2020. As the device load increases and the volume of devices rise and project activity volumes to the service provider, this requires a large-scale server farm to handle the large amount of data. Instead, enhanced management and processing will allow for the seamless transfer of data between devices and servers.</H4>
