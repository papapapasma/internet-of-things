    1. Enterprise Asset Management
</p>
<P>
    <b>
        Enterprise asset management involves measures taken to improve device and machine health to achieve greater output. It is among the prime internet of things examples in the industrial setup. Machines retrofitted with IoT sensors inform users about the machine’s current status and whether it needs any maintenance. It allows for more efficient checks for safety and compliance purposes

    2. Predictive Maintenance
</p>
<p>
    <b>
        Lack of proper maintenance is among the primary causes for a reduced lifetime of the machines. The application of IoT in maintenance involves using sensors inside robots and other automated devices to predict whether a failure is likely to occur or not. Based on certain preset thresholds, the sensors indicate the extent to which maintenance might be required.

    3. Industrial Process Automation/Optimisation
</p>
<P>
    <b>
        This may be considered the most important one among the internet of things examples in an industrial setup. Most industrial processes can be automated remotely without having to be anywhere close to the actual machines. Devices fitted with IoT sensors detect signals over wireless networks and get to work on precisely the task that has been assigned.

    4. Energy Management
</P>
<P>
    <b>
        Among the primary Internet of Things examples across several fields is the management of the power consumed by devices, especially in the manufacturing industry, where massive amounts of power is utilised. When used aptly, IoT devices can help predict individual devices’ power utilisation and help reduce over-utilisation by using them judiciously or in a power-saving mode.

    5. Outdoor Surveillance
</p>
<p>
    <b>
        This is among the primary internet of things examples in daily life. If your outdoor camera is IoT enabled, you can get information about whether there is an intrusion in your house or if someone is at the door. More advanced IoT devices will also be able to predict who is at the door and inform you through face-mapping technology.

    6. Smart Lighting
</p>
<p>
    <b>
        This is another one of the Internet of Things examples that have gradually been coming into common usage. Bulbs and battens connected to Wifi can be turned on and off remotely. Schedule for usage can be set for these devices along with their brightnesses controlled and their power consumption monitored. Using other IoT devices, smart lighting devices can also be turned on and off by voice alone. The power consumption of these devices can

    7. Electronic Road Toll Collection and Traffic Management
</P>
<p>
    <b>
        Using the data generated by cameras and other IoT devices, traffic regulators can automate the timings of traffic lights on busy roads and highways. This can go a long way in making roads safer and less susceptible to accidents. IoT devices can also be used to make road toll completely automated. This is done by detecting when a car is driven into the toll collection zone and lifting the barrier only once the toll has been paid.
